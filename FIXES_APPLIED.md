# âœ… Fixed: Authentication & Logo Issues

## Issues Resolved

### 1. âœ… Looping Credential Check (UNAUTHORIZED Errors)

**Problem:** The application was continuously making API calls that returned UNAUTHORIZED errors because authentication was disabled but the middleware still required a user.

**Solution:**

- Modified `/src/libs/trpc/middleware/userAuth.ts` to check if authentication is completely disabled (`!enableAuth`)
- When auth is disabled, the middleware now automatically provides an anonymous user ID
- Created an `anonymous-user` in the PostgreSQL database to handle unauthenticated access

**Files Modified:**

- `src/libs/trpc/middleware/userAuth.ts` - Added check for `!enableAuth` condition
- `.env` - Added `MOCK_DEV_USER_ID=development-user` (optional fallback)
- Created SQL script: `create-anonymous-user.sql`

**Database Changes:**

```sql
-- Created anonymous user in database
INSERT INTO users (id, username, email, avatar, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES ('anonymous-user', 'Anonymous User', 'anonymous@inqubatorai.local', null, NOW(), NOW());

INSERT INTO user_settings (id) VALUES ('anonymous-user');
```

### 2. âœ… Empty Logo String Warning

**Problem:** Browser console showed warning about empty string in `src` attribute for the logo image.

**Solution:**
Changed `BRANDING_LOGO_URL` from empty string to `null` in `/packages/const/src/branding.ts`

**Files Modified:**

- `packages/const/src/branding.ts` - Changed `BRANDING_LOGO_URL = ''` to `BRANDING_LOGO_URL = null`

## Current Status

### âœ… Working

- Server mode is enabled and running
- PostgreSQL database connected
- MinIO S3 storage operational
- Anonymous user authentication working
- No more credential check loops
- Logo warning resolved

### Application Access

- **URL:** <http://localhost:3010>
- **User:** Anonymous (no login required)
- **Status:** Ready to use!

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow (when disabled)

1. User accesses the application
2. Middleware checks `enableAuth` flag
3. Since auth is disabled (`NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NEXT_AUTH=0`), middleware assigns `anonymous-user` ID
4. Application functions normally with anonymous user

### Why This Works

- Server mode requires a user ID for database operations
- When authentication is disabled, we provide a default "anonymous" user
- This allows single-user or development scenarios without full auth setup
- The anonymous user has full access to create sessions, messages, etc.

---

## Next Steps

### To Enable Full Authentication Later:

1. Fix Docker file sharing permissions (add `/Users/corneliushatchett/Downloads` to Docker Desktop settings)
2. Uncomment Casdoor service in `docker-compose.development.yml`
3. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NEXT_AUTH=1` in `.env`
4. Restart services: `./stop-server-mode.sh && ./start-server-mode.sh`

### Alternative Authentication Options:

- **OAuth Providers:** GitHub, Google, Microsoft, etc.
- **Logto:** Open-source auth service (files in `docker-compose/local/logto/`)
- **Zitadel:** Enterprise-grade IAM (files in `docker-compose/local/zitadel/`)

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:

- `create-anonymous-user.sql` - SQL script to create anonymous user
- `SERVER_MODE_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - Setup documentation
- `start-server-mode.sh` - Script to start all services
- `stop-server-mode.sh` - Script to stop all services
- `docker-compose/local/.env` - Docker Compose environment configuration

### Modified:

- `.env` - Added server mode configuration and development user ID
- `src/libs/trpc/middleware/userAuth.ts` - Added anonymous user support
- `packages/const/src/branding.ts` - Fixed logo URL and updated branding to InQubatorAI
- `docker-compose.development.yml` - Updated volume configurations and temporarily disabled Casdoor/SearXNG
- `docker-compose/local/docker-compose.yml` - Changed volume mounts from bind mounts to named volumes

---

## Testing

To verify everything is working:

1. **Open the application:** <http://localhost:3010>
2. **Check for errors:** Browser console should be clean (except the Turbopack warning which is harmless)
3. **Test functionality:**
   - Create a new chat session
   - Send a message (will need AI provider API key)
   - Check settings/preferences

---

## Known Limitations (Temporary)

1. **No user authentication** - Single anonymous user for now
2. **Casdoor disabled** - Authentication service not running due to Docker file permissions
3. **SearXNG disabled** - Search engine not running due to Docker file permissions
4. **Logo not set** - Using text logo "InQubatorAI" instead of image

These can all be addressed as next steps based on your priorities.
